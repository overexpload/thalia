At Thalia, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue within the project, please report it to us promptly. We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain the security of our software. 🛡️

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

2. **Provide Details:** Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact.
3. **Be Patient:** We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and work towards addressing the issue in a timely manner. ⏳

## Scope

The following guidelines outline the scope of our security policy:

- **In Scope:** Any security vulnerabilities discovered within the Thalia project itself, including its codebase, dependencies, and infrastructure.
- **Out of Scope:** Security issues related to third-party services, websites, or applications not directly maintained by Thalia. 🚫

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices when reporting security vulnerabilities to us. This includes:

- Providing reasonable time for us to investigate and address the reported vulnerability before disclosing it to others.
